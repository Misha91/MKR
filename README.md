<b>Guide:  </b>
<br/>
If you are working under any function/task, change top line to *IN PROGRESS*, commit and push it to repo with message like "MI - in progress" - this will let us know if work in progress and let us to avoid any merge conflict (git commit -m "MI - in progress").  
<br/>
!!! Don't forget to pull and fetch actual repo before you start working on (see command below) !!!  
!!! Don't forget to push after work is done and update this readme !!!  
<br/>
It would be also nice to indicate which function you are working on, for example:  
A* planning - *MI*  
<br/>
Finished work to be indicated as:  
A* planning - MI  
<br/>
Feel free to split any task on any number of sub-tasks, it's easier to do few small tasks rather than one big.  
<br />
Install stdr_simulator and turtlebot_simulator packages yourself, because it depends on the version of ROS that you have
